# SharpeRatio
The most popular performance metric in investing is the Sharpe ratio!  The Sharpe ratio tells you the "risk-adjusted" return of an investment. It’s a great way to compare strategies because it normalizes their returns by risk.  If you’re investing or trading, you might want to consider the Sharpe ratio as one of your performance metrics.
